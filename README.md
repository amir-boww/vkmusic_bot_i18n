## Translation guidelines
1. Feel free to modify any .po file and send me a pull request with your changes
2. You need to modify only `msgstr` parts of the file
3. Please do not add/remove any lines in tranaslation text
4. Try to keep the same line lengths as the original English 
4. Do not touch `\n` symbols or any emojis
5. Do not translate commands (e.g. `/save`, `/my`, etc) — let them be in English
6. Don't give a fuck about all these **DO NOT**'s above — never mind if you missed them and fucked up something. Send me a pull request anyway, I will fix all the mess for you!
7. If you don't see a file for you language, feel free to copy `en/` dir to whatever language you want to add

You can help yourself with a special software to edit .po files — https://poedit.net/
